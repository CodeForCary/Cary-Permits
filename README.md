Scrapes Cary Permit Data

This is a very crude scrape of the Cary Building Permits database.

$ php scrape.php
    will scrape for the year specified in the source as $year and starts at permit number $start_permit. 
    (yes I know that is crude)
    Data will be appended to 20xx_permits.csv
    
The scrape2.php file was used when we were trying to establish whether any meaningful data existed with other years 
such as AA. It is in an unknown state.
